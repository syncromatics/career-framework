# Internship Framework

Internships at GMV Syncromatics are focused, time-limited programs for interns to develop practical engineering experience, and for GMV Syncromatics to invest in people in junior positions.

## Overview

The Internship Framework is designed to focus on building up the intern. We set clear expectations and ensure that interns paired up with a mentor during the program. This framework is a part of our larger [Career Framework][career-framework], and the goal of a successful internship is to develop an intern's skills to an [Associate][career-framework-titles] level.

Our interns are paid employees. As such, interns have well-defined responsibilities and maintain open and respectful communication with co-workers. You will not be asked to fetch coffee for anyone. (Our kitchen is open and anyone, including our interns, can make their own coffee.)

## Timeline

An internship is a focused, time-limited program. Before making an internship available, we have defined a scope of work that includes time for on-boarding, mentorship, specific engineering work, and wrap-up. An internship will typically last 10-12 weeks, be part-time, and may be tailored as needed to suit a person's schedule.

We are open to applications from anyone. Please review our [current internships][current-internships] for our availabilities, and follow the application instructions there.

An example internship follows a structure:

| Week | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 1    | Introduction to team<br>Overview of company and products<br>Goal-setting with mentor<br>Introduction to engineering processes |
| 2    | Plan out work<br>Get hands on with code and/or hardware<br>Meet with mentor (ask questions, get feedback, seek help, share something exciting) |
| 3-8  | Make progress on planned work<br>Work primarily with the engineering team<br>Meet with mentor (ask questions, get feedback, seek help, share something exciting) |
| 9    | Begin wrapping up work<br>Prepare presentation on work |
| 10   | Culminate internship with a presentation |

While we cannot guarantee any promise of future employment, our goal in providing internships is to hopefully find people who do excellent work and want to continue working with the team. Interns who are hired at the end of the internship will be hired at an [Associate][career-framework-titles], with new responsibilities and a focus on more self-directed work within the team.

## Selection Criteria

We are looking for people who are interested in people, mobility, and technology. If you are excited about the [things we're excited about][career-framework-about], apply!
