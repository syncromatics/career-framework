# GMV Syncromatics Engineering Career Framework

## About GMV Syncromatics

GMV Syncromatics is a Software-as-a-Service and hardware integrator that makes products for transit agencies and operators. Simply, we help our customers _do_ transit and connect with their riders.

The whole Syncromatics team shares three core values:

* We deliver on our promises
* We solve problems
* We share knowledge


## About GMV Syncromatics Engineering

The GMV Syncromatics Engineering team is made of the people who define, design, and implement transit solutions. Within this team, there are two groups who work closely together: software and system integration.

We are an agile team. (In both the "agile" and "Agile" senses.) Iteration and delivery are key drivers for us. We are frequently exploring the edges of new technology looking for new and better ways to get things done.

We love our craft. We work on a range of problems whose solutions directly impact people's ability to move around. Finding new, creative, and efficient ways to increase people's mobility is exciting, as is finding new algorithms for predicting bus arrivals and designing ruggedized hardware. 

We love and support the engineering community. As much as is possible, we strive to make our software open source and available to others. Developing relationships alongside technology is important to us.


## About the career framework

We took a lot of inspiration from Buffer's [Engineering Career Paths Framework][eng-career-paths-fx]. (Thanks [Katie][katie-womersley]!) Particularly, Buffer's "focus on the journey, the growth and evolution that is a career" is exactly the focus we want to have for the GMV Syncromatics Engineering team.

We have built this career framework to have two dimensions: Title and Distinction. The title describes a person's scope of influence and ownership of their work. The distinction describes a person's domain of expertise.


### Titles

## Evaluating growth and evolution

GMV Syncromatics relies on annual "360° reviews" where each person in the company reviews themselves and a number of their peers. These reviews are compiled by managers into anonymized feedback for each person reviewed.

Below are the questions and statements that make up our 360° reviews. The nearly all of the responses are a rating of confidence or agreement with the statement and a short comment.

### Mission

* In a critical moment, do you trust this employee to make decisions that are in the best interests of the customer and the company?
* If you were starting a company, would you hire this person for the role they have now?
* How upset or concerned would you be if this person were to leave the company tomorrow?

### Delivering on Promises

* This person is empathetic to customer needs.
* This person is more focused on finding solutions than just reporting problems.
* This person works with a sense of urgency when the situation requires it.

* This person seeks out and/or is receptive to feedback.
* This person puts the team/company ahead of their individual desires.
* This person not only completes their work, but is also effective at communicating and documenting the work completed.

### Final Thoughts
