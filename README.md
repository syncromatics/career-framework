# GMV Syncromatics Engineering Career Framework

## About GMV Syncromatics

GMV Syncromatics is a Software-as-a-Service and hardware integrator that makes products for transit agencies and operators. Simply, we help our customers _do_ transit and connect with their riders.

The whole Syncromatics team shares three core values:

- We deliver on our promises
- We solve problems
- We share knowledge

## About GMV Syncromatics Engineering

The GMV Syncromatics Engineering team is made of the people who define, design, and implement transit solutions. Within this team, there are two groups who work closely together: software and system integration.

We are an agile team. (In both the "agile" and "Agile" senses.) Iteration and delivery are key drivers for us. We are frequently exploring the edges of new technology looking for new and better ways to get things done.

We love our craft. We work on a range of problems whose solutions directly impact people's ability to move around. Finding new, creative, and efficient ways to increase people's mobility is exciting, as is finding new algorithms for predicting bus arrivals and designing ruggedized hardware.

We love and support the engineering community. As much as is possible, we strive to make our software open source and available to others. Developing relationships alongside technology is important to us.

## About the career framework

We took a lot of inspiration from Buffer's [Engineering Career Paths Framework][eng-career-paths-fx]. (Thanks [Katie][katie-womersley]!) Particularly, Buffer's "focus on the journey, the growth and evolution that is a career" is exactly the focus we want to have for the GMV Syncromatics Engineering team.

We have built this career framework to have two dimensions: Title and Distinction. The title describes a person's scope of influence and ownership of their work. The distinction describes a person's domain of expertise.

## Team Organization

Our Engineering department is organized into "Squads". A Squad is an unit of Software Engineering that can independently design and deliver on Product, Platform, Devices or SRE initiatives. The full-stack nature of a squad goes deep and wide. A Squad comprises of 3 - 4 Software Engineers (including a Lead), 1 - 2 QA Engineer(s). Squads also include a single Product Manager and contributions from a UI & UX Designer, who may be members of multiple squads.

Squads are independent Engineering resources each assigned to one Product Area or Vertical at any point of time, collaborating on technical architecture, best practice, and releases with fair opporunity for internal mobility and vertical growth.
