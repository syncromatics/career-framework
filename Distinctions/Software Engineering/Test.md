# Distinction: Software Engineering, Test

The Test distinction primarily involves testability, repeatability, quality assurance, and automation. It also includes practices of diagnosis and prevention. This distinction is focused on approaching matters of quality with the mindset and tools of a software engineer.

## Typical sprint work

In addition to the common [typical sprint work](Common.md#typical-sprint-work), you will practice your distinction a number of ways.

### Grooming

You will work with the product team to offer technical feedback on acceptance criteria and test case development. You will help determine key areas to focus testing efforts on, including assessing risk factors associated with proposed changes.

### Story work

You will work with the engineering team to iterate on testing systems and standards, test case management, and test automation.

### Code review

During code reviews, you will also work to assess risk factors in the code and ensure that the code is appropriately covered by tests. (e.g., unit or integration tests, end-to-end tests, or appropriate acceptance criteria.)

### Quality Working Group

(The Quality Working Group is a cross-department, multidisciplinary group of people organized to maintain a high level of quality within the company.)

You will work with the Quality Working Group in the development and maintenance of comprehensive quality guidelines and processes. You will also take part in the review of root cause analyses.

## Areas of growth

- Familiarization, implementation, and development of testing systems and standards
- Measuring and improving software quality
- Developing robust systems and processes for testing resilient software intended for mobile and IoT devices

## Examples of challenges

- Measuring test coverage across dozens of applications and services
- Implementing test case management proceses and systems
- Implementing automated testing systems
- Developing automated tests for websites and mobile apps
- Developing protocols for testing IoT devices

## Significant contributions


### Within the team

You contribute to your fellow software engineers' experience by improving the feedback from testing systems. You assess risk in software development practices and identify ways of mitigating that risk.

### Within the company

Your work helps improve our customers' experience of our system and helps our project managers and support staff provide consistently high-quality service.

### Within the user base

You contribute to improving the critical moments when software does not work as intended, whether by directly participating in troubleshooting or in developing systems for mitigating defects.

### Within the engineering community

You contribute to the maintenance and reliability of our open source projects.

### Within the public

Your work is a largely-invisible quality of the system that transit riders interact with.
