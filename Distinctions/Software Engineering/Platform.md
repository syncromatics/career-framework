# Distinction: Software Engineering, Platform

The Platform distinction primarily involves design, architecture, and implementation of Software-as-a-Service technologies. It includes databases, data structures, algorithms, and microservices.

The focus of this distinction mostly consists of "backend" technology that is not used directly by humans. This work is centered around the machine-to-machine technology that supports the company's products.

## Typical sprint work

In addition to the common [typical sprint work](Common.md#typical-sprint-work), you will practice your distinction a number of ways.


### Grooming

You will work with the engineering team to offer technical feedback on design and implementation of services and processes that support the company's products and services. You will propose code changes and infrastructure and advocate for ways to address business needs and solve problems.

### Story work

You will work with the engineering team to iterate on services and implementations.

### Code review

During code reviews, you will also work to ensure the implementation will thrive within the infrastrcture and not introduce undesired dependencies or load on the system. You will have focus on evaluating data structures for suitability to their use.
