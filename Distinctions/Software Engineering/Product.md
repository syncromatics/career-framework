# Distinction: Software Engineering, Product

The Product distinction primarily involves design, architecture, and implementation of user experience, including third-party developer experience. It includes a focus on polish and reliability of the finished product. This distinction is focused on the human-software interactions at all levels of our system.

## Typical sprint work

In addition to the common [typical sprint work](Common.md#typical-sprint-work), you will practice your distinction a number of ways.


### Grooming

You will work with the product team to offer technical feedback on user interface and user experience and to work out how to implement the planned product work.

### Story work

You will work with the product team to iterate on user experience. This kind of work is often done either "over the shoulder," done in a shared integration environment, or using a tool like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/), or [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/).

### Code review

During code reviews, you will also work to ensure the user experience of the product is maintained or improved.

## Areas of growth

* Familiarization, implementation, and development of accessibility, user interface, and user experience design systems, e.g.:
  * [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
  * [A11y Project](https://a11yproject.com/checklist.html)
  * [Material System](https://material.io/design/)
  * [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/)
* Measuring and improving human experience with our software and processes, e.g.:
  * Rider experience
  * Driver, dispatcher, planner (i.e., "customer") experience
  * Developer experience
* Stewardship of open source projects and interaction with the open source community

## Examples of challenges

* Displaying hundreds of vehicles on a map that updates in real-time
* Displaying real-time video from on-vehicle cameras
* Developing web pages that are resilient to unstable network connections
* Displaying real-time content on internet-connected signs
* Integrating software telephony (VOIP) into a web app and an Android app

## Significant contributions

### Within the team

You contribute to your fellow software engineers' experience by working on continually improving developer experience.

### Within the company

Your work is the most visible part of the company's product.

### Within the user base

Your work is the interface drivers use to stay connected to dispatchers, dispatchers use to stay informed of their transit systems, and planners use to inform usage and policy decisions.

### Within the engineering community

You contribute to the maintenance and accessibility of our open source projects.

### Within the public

Your work is an interface by which riders make use of their transit systems.
