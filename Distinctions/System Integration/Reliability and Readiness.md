# Distinction: Software Engineering, Reliability & Readiness

The Reliability & Readiness distinction primarily involves testability, repeatability, and quality assurance. There is an emphasis on ensuring the software and hardware work together in harsh environments. It involves working closely with the Operations team to solve problems as they arise and to provide specific engineering specifications for different vehicles.
